# PHP-Developer-Test

**Task 1:**
You can find the code in the `View` folder with the file titled `task-1.php`. I have structured the code to follow the Model-View-Controller **(MVC)** architecture to maintain readability and improve the organization of the codebase.

**Task 2:**
You can find the code in the `PostgreSQL` folder with the file titled `task-2.md`. This file contains an explanation of the used code along with notes and my personal reflections on the task.
